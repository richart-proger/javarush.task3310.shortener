Shortener is a kind of analog of the Google URL shortener link Shortener (https://goo.gl), but with extended functionality. It shortens not only links, but also any strings.
Our Shortener is a class that can return a unique identifier for any string, and vice versa, return a string based on a previously received identifier.
